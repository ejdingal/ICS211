Algorithm Analysis

My selection sort's runtime was always around ~0.5sec. It has a Big O of n^2, because
the algorithm would run through each element and sort it into the already sorted array
to the left. After running through the array element, it would run the second part of 
the array to find where an element belongs.

My Bubble sort's runtime runs at about ~2.4sec. It has a Big O of n, because it will
check one element, pushing to the top as needed, then moving to the next index of the
array, pushing that element to the top as it is needed. It checks each index of the
array only once.

My insertion sort's runtime is near ~1.2sec. It has a Big O of N, because it will check
the second element and check if the one to the left is smaller, swapping if needed.
Then it checks the next element swapping to the left for smaller elements if needed,
this will run through the array only once and ensures the smallest elements are kept left.
