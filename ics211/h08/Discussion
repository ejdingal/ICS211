**Discussion**

  I think that during examples 3 and 4, there is a lot more backtracking for the recursion.
  It could be that there is a lot more backtracking happening towards the end where it continually reaches the 
  near end and then it has to back track. Also during the first one, it has more options of being right, while
  in the later examples there is less places for the Sudoku to be different leading to a smaller number of possible solutions.
